# Trusties

Trusties is a final project in the computer science degree (B.Sc).<br />
The project contains both the server side and the client side.<br />
The client side is an Android application written in JAVA and the server side is written in Node.js using JWT and the MongoDB database.

#

Trusties is a social network that provides a solution to your daily problems.<br />
We offer a reliable user community based on the user's contact circles who wants to volunteer and help with simple problems. such as: car malfunctions, electronic device issues, simple malfunctions in home appliances and even offers safe rides and deliveries!<br />
Unlike apps that are available on the market today, Trusties emphasizes on reliability so SOS alerts will be sent only to people who are in your contact circles.

npm install copy-node-modules --save-dev
